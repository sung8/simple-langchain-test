```
1. Fix by installing Rust at https://rustup.rs/
 * Windows: Add Rust as an environment variable to **both** User and System PATH 
 * Where to find? C:/Users/[username]/.cargo/bin
 * Rust installer should auto-add environment variable to User PATH
 * Add System path manually
 * Resolves pip install errors
2. Restart PyCharm
3. Try `pip install -r gorilla-requirements.txt` again
